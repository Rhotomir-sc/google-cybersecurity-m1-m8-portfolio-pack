# Controls Mapping (Module 2)

## Controls used
- Preventive: password policy, least privilege, patching routine
- Detective: log review, admin change monitoring, auth failure monitoring
- Corrective: account reset steps, recovery/rollback, incident reporting

## Why it matters
Controls translate “risk talk” into actionable security practice.
