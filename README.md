# Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate - Portfolio

## Overview

This repository documents my practical work completed alongside the **Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate**.

Rather than using the repository as a collection of course notes, I focused on converting the material into security artifacts, technical analysis, scripts, investigation workflows, and documented findings.

The portfolio covers:

```text
Security Foundations
Risk & Controls
Network Security
Linux & SQL
Threats & Vulnerabilities
Detection & Incident Response
Python Automation
Career Preparation
```

It also includes an **Integrated Security Case** that connects these areas into a single investigation workflow.

## Professional Certificate

**Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate**  
**Issued by:** Google / Coursera  
**Completed:** June 1, 2026  
**Courses Completed:** 9

[View Certificate and Credential Details](certificate/README.md)

The certificate currently contains nine courses.

This repository focuses primarily on the first eight cybersecurity-focused courses.

The ninth course, **Accelerate Your Job Search with AI**, is career-development focused and is documented through the credential rather than as a separate technical module.

# Featured Project - Integrated Security Case

The strongest project in this repository is the:

## Northstar Solutions Integrated Security Case

This fictional investigation combines concepts from multiple certificate modules.

The workflow follows:

```text
Asset Identification
        ↓
Risk Assessment
        ↓
Security Controls
        ↓
Authentication Analysis
        ↓
Linux Web Log Analysis
        ↓
SQL Investigation
        ↓
Detection & Incident Response
        ↓
Python Automation
        ↓
Final Assessment
```

The case includes:

- fictional security datasets
- authentication analysis
- Linux web-log investigation
- SQL security queries
- detection logic
- incident-response assessment
- Python authentication automation
- remediation recommendations

The Python script analyses authentication events and identifies repeated failures followed by successful access from the same source.

# Hands-On Security Practice

The Google portfolio focuses on structured security fundamentals and portfolio artifacts.

Additional hands-on defensive security work is documented separately in my TryHackMe repository:

**[TryHackMe Cybersecurity Portfolio](https://github.com/Rhotomir-sc/tryhackme-portfolio-pack)**

The TryHackMe portfolio includes practical work in areas such as:

- Linux administration
- permissions and least privilege
- Wireshark traffic analysis
- Nmap host discovery
- log analysis
- SIEM alert triage
- incident response
- threat intelligence
- Windows Event Logs
- cloud identity
- firewall auditing
- phishing analysis

Module-to-lab relationships are documented here:

[Google ↔ TryHackMe Lab Mapping](related-tryhackme-labs.md)

# Evidence Philosophy

This portfolio is designed around:

```text
Evidence > Claims
```

Screenshots are included only when they provide useful proof of technical work, such as:

- command execution
- script output
- analysis results
- system observations
- investigation findings

Course slides, repetitive screenshots, and screenshots that do not demonstrate practical work are intentionally avoided.

# Current Direction

My current technical development is focused on:

```text
Cloud Security
        +
Identity Security
        +
SOC / Incident Response
```

with future expansion into:

```text
Cloud Security Engineering
AI Security
Security Automation
```

---

# Portfolio Approach

The repositories in my portfolio serve different purposes:

```text
Google Cybersecurity Portfolio
→ structured foundations + security artifacts

TryHackMe Portfolio
→ hands-on defensive security labs

Integrated Security Case
→ multi-stage investigation and correlation

Future Security Projects
→ deeper cloud, identity, automation, and AI-security work
```

This separation keeps course learning, practical labs, and larger security projects organised without duplicating evidence.

Some scenarios and datasets in this repository are fictional and were created for educational and portfolio purposes.

Conclusions are intentionally limited to what the available evidence supports.
